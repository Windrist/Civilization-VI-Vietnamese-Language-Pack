And control them they did, even channeling the flow through palgum – small-scale canals – to feed elaborate gardens. While the Hanging Gardens of Babylon have not been as well documented as historians may have hoped, at Nineveh, the Assyrian king Sennacherib built a luxurious garden fed by aqueducts and elaborate canals – often the same waterway at different points, cutting through mountains and rising over canyons - that allowed for exotic trees such as ebony and rosewood to grow within the palace. These canals were reinforced by great limestone blocks and controlled by specialized sluice gates. The King was proud of these – he inscribed, “over deep-cut ravines, I spanned a bridge of white stone blocks. Those waters I caused to pass over upon it.” The Yazidi ethnic group in Iraq kept up this tradition of building elaborate aqueducts and canals well into the 20th century.</Text>

Mueang were “mandala states,” kingdoms without defined borders but centered on a city that stressed beauty, artistic achievements, and cosmopolitan outlook – think of countries in that time not as the bounded puzzle pieces we see on a map today (or the bordered civilizations in your current game), but as magnets, drawing in people and power from the landscape.

Relatedly, and like its larger relative, Timbuktu, Chinguetti was home to a number of famous libraries, places where pilgrims could share all that they had found on their travels. This went well beyond religion to include mathematics, science, astronomy, and especially Islamic law. These centers of scholarship – ksour – were bastions of Islamic life and commerce and would have been oases of learning in the desert.</Text>

			<Text>Nalanda – literally “the gift of the lotus” - was a city in eastern India that achieved fame during the late first millennium AD for being a center for Buddhist learning. Scholars came from all around India, as well as China and Tibet, to learn from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, Dignaga, and Santaraksita. Buddhism today is broadly split into three main schools of thought: one common in Nepal and Tibet (Vajrayana), one common in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (Theravada), and another spread across East Asia (Mahayana). In Nalanda, scholars debated all of these schools of thought, and Buddhist schools named for the great city now exist in places as far-flung as Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.</Text>

Nearly a thousand years later, in 629 AD, the Chinese monk Xuanzang visited Nalanda and brought Buddhist knowledge back to China. His travels were given a fanciful gloss in the famous Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” one of the most beloved Chinese epics. Xuanzang described Nalanda thusly: "an azure pool winds around the monasteries, adorned with the full-blown cups of the blue lotus; the dazzling red flowers of the lovely kanaka hang here and there, and outside groves of mango trees offer the inhabitants their dense and protective shade.”</Text>

The materials used were not simply piled atop each other, rather, the different qualities of building materials caused the four sides to lean into each other, further supporting the structure.

Le Corbusier’s buildings were often criticized, though, for their numbing quality and inorganic lines. Kenzo Tange, a student of Le Corbusier, sought to change this. Combining Le Corbusier’s sweeping concrete vision, Tange’s “metabolism” combined modern forms with organic ones and became influential in 1960s-era Japan and beyond.

		<Text>Colonial rule at the time wasn’t the more clear-cut military domination that it came to be in the later part of the 19th century. Instead, it involved a great deal of semi-colonial statuses – sultans might be paid off (more or less voluntarily) into becoming quiet puppet states, might be tempted to join a colony voluntarily, or might be the victim of a coup d’etat or military takeover. The British especially often tempted local lords with luxury goods or infrastructure projects, then claimed land when sultans spent more than they could pay.</Text>

He began his life aboard ship off of the British colony of Jamaica in 1781. He started his professional career as a clerk for the British East India company, and was posted at a young age to Malaya – a series of sultanates on the peninsula between independent Siam (Thailand) and the islands of Dutch-controlled Indonesia. The British were eager to chip away at Dutch profits in the spice trade, and to secure passage for ships moving from India to China but were wary of provoking a war that might have repercussions back in Europe.</Text>

		<Text>What Raffles is most famous for, though, is Singapore. The island was perfectly situated – just on the Straits of Malacca, but just out of Dutch control. At the time, the island was not the major city that it is today, but rather a small fishing village, nominally part of the Johor Sultanate. But who really ruled it was in question, especially when the younger son of the sultan seized power when his older brother was away. Raffles arranged for a coup in Johor, and, safely installed on the throne, the new sultan granted the British control over the island in 1819.</Text>

While the Dutch remained a major player in Southeast Asia, Singapore marked the establishment of British power in the region and a vital link in keeping trade between Hong Kong and India under British control. Today, Singapore remains in a sense similar to Raffles’s vision – a multi-ethnic port situated at one of the busiest and most important straits in the world.</Text>

Zhang Heng was able to demonstrate that the moon did not shine with its own light, and was able to explain lunar eclipses (again, valuable to show the heavenly knowledge of the imperial court).

For instance, Ibn Khaldun introduces a cyclical notion of history. Whereas previous thinkers saw a gradual rise towards sedentary, agricultural life, Ibn Khaldun noted how periods of nomadic (Berber) rule came on the heels of settled life, and presented the tension between two ways of living – settled societies eventually decay, and more dynamic, adaptable nomads conquer them, only to find themselves growing accustomed to the comfort of their former foes. Such an idea was not to enter European thought until the work of Karl Marx, who also presented a notion of a productive clash between different economic modes as the driver of history.</Text>

		<Text>Famously, the cultural anthropologist Margaret Mead was asked what she thought was the quintessential sign of civilization. In response, she said, “a healed femur.” By this, Mead was indicating the urge to help defenseless or weakened others in our society, and civilization as the system through which we bind ourselves together in mutual support. Mead’s anthropology involved in-depth ethnography, meaning a method of gathering data gained by living with people from very different backgrounds and seeking to understand them through shared personal experience. For anthropologists, seeing through very different eyes allows us to question what we might take for granted in our own society. Mead’s study of adolescence and sexuality in Samoa challenged conservative American cultural norms and became pivotal to the sexual revolution in the 1960s. Instead of a period where sexuality was held back from adolescents, and a natural conflict between parents and children, Mead found a more open acceptance of sexuality, and a lack of conflict. This, and Mead’s more interpretive approach (i.e. seeing anthropology as something more akin to history or literature than a “hard” science) led to a backlash from some circles, one that had more to do with present-day American politics than the quality of her work.</Text>

		<Text>One of the pioneers of modern art, Wassily Kandinsky fused painting with philosophy, reflecting a world profoundly changed over the course of World War I, the Russian Revolution and World War II, at each point when the world seemed to be breaking down and rebuilding itself from the basic elements up. Modernism as a movement is a reaction to this reshaping of the world – "modernism" here does not mean up-to-date, rather, it is an attention to and rearrangement of the basic elements that make up a work. Modern art tries to play with these basic elements, giving up trying to represent objects and instead asking what effect a certain color or angle or arrangement would have upon the viewer, without the mess of asking, "what is this a painting of?". In other words, two lines in opposition might create a sense of drama; one soaring line might evoke lyricism. Circles are peaceful; colors have inherent resonances with particular sounds. This is not symbolism – it is not that Kandinsky's canvases are mysteries to be decoded; rather, the elements themselves share a fundamental link in Kandinsky's theory. Kandinsky's theoretical work became influential to the larger modernist and abstract movement and remains so today.</Text>

		<Text>Ragtime was a piano style that came out of the African American community around the turn of the 20th century, and Scott Joplin was ragtime’s king. Combining Western piano music, especially marches, with African melodies, ragtime was characterized by the presence of a syncopated melody between the meter, giving the piece a “ragged” flavor or, to use Joplin’s word, a “swing.” Ragtime was popular in the 1890s – 1910s, before recorded music was widely available, and as such, it spread via sheet music or simply learned in performance. Ragtime, a largely African American musical style, broke the color barrier in music, a feat that was to be repeated with blues, jazz, rock, hip-hop, and other African American styles that defined larger American culture. Even overseas, European composers saw in ragtime their own growing interest in folk music reflected back with a distinctively American feel, and Dvorak, Stravinsky, and Debussy each were inspired to compose their own rags.</Text>

Smith College and continued to compose. His “Maple Leaf Rag” achieved international success, earning him enough to keep him composing, and Joplin moved on to experiment with opera and stage performance. Joplin died in 1917, and his music faded in fame over time, being “rediscovered” in the 1940s and again in the 1970s. Its influence, however, remained, hiding between the notes like any good rag.</Text>
