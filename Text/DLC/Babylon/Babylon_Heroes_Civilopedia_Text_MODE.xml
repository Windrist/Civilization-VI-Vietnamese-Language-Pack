Anansi went about this not directly, but using the vanity and pride of the great beasts against them. For instance, he let the great python &quot;accidentally&quot; overhear Anansi speculating that the snake wasn’t nearly as long as a nearby branch, and when the python laid down next to the tree to show Anansi his length, Anansi bound him to the branch and captured him. After Nyame saw Anansi’s cleverness, he agreed that from that point on, all stories should belong to the spider, and this is why West Africans tell Anansi stories, and not Nyame stories.</Text>

Beowulf is a hero of the Geats, a people that inhabited a part of what is today Sweden. He arrives in the hall of Hrothgar, a king of the Danes, whose lands are under assault by a monster named Grendel – a cannibal beast perhaps thematically related to the trolls of Scandinavian myth, but whom the poem identifies as a cursed descendant of the Biblical Cain.</Text>

Beowulf abandons his weapons, wanting to test his strength against the beast as equals. The two lock arms and, after a fierce grapple, Beowulf rips one of Grendel’s arms off with his bare hands. The troll, mortally wounded, hobbles back to its home. Back there, Grendel’s bog-witch mother receives her dying son and is consumed with anger, and Beowulf must again do battle.</Text>

Beowulf, prideful as always, insists on battling the beast alone, but a young warrior, Wiglaf, seeing that the old king is going to his death, disobeys and remains by the king’s side. In the fight, the dragon is slain, but Beowulf is bitten by its poisonous fangs and dies. Wiglaf buries the king in a tall barrow at the sea’s edge.</Text>

It carries with it both a valorization of a warrior’s strength and cautions against pride – both Hrothgar’s pride at his riches, and Beowulf’s pride in his own power. Historically, Beowulf remains an artifact of a moment in time when a population that had nominally Christianized struggled with its pagan past, and an icon of England’s Scandinavian legacy.</Text>

			<Text>Heracles – better-known in English by his Roman name, Hercules – is the son of Zeus, and a hero that epitomized strength, if not good judgement. Hera, Zeus’s wife, hated Heracles for being the product of one of Zeus’s many affairs, and sought to bring ruin upon him however she could. This started in the cradle, as Hera sent snakes to kill the infant Heracles. Even then the boy was strong enough to overcome the serpents, and his strength only grew. His wisdom, however, did not keep pace with his physical strength: Heracles killed his music tutor with a lyre, threw a close friend (whose father and brothers he also slew) over a wall, tossed the herald Lichas into the sea, and, most tragically, killed his own children.</Text>

			<Text>Though a figure of legend today, Queen Himiko was likely a real person. She was the queen of Yamatai, on the islands that the Chinese called Wa – present-day Japan. In Chinese records, Himiko sent gifts to the Cao Wei kingdom: the northernmost of the three states that divided China between them in the 3rd century A.D. In these records Himiko is dubbed &quot;Queen of Wa (Japan), and friend of Wei&quot; by the Chinese emperor.</Text>

Chinese sources recount that she bewitched all of the residents of Wa into submitting to her rule, how she lived in a great castle served entirely by female attendants and guards (excepting one man, who brought her food), and rarely left. This mystical reputation is compounded in Japanese records, which identify Himiko with a number of divine beings: as the high shaman of the Japanese sun-goddess Amaterasu, or a shamanic wife of a divine snake. In this latter story, Himiko (identified by the name Yamato-toto-hi-momo-so-bime no Mikoto) is happily married to a clearly divine being, but who only visits at night. She begs him to stay until morning so that she can see him in the sunlight, but he demurs. Eventually, she convinces him, and he tells her that she will see him in her toilet-case, but she must promise not to be shocked at his appearance. The next morning, when she opens the case, there is a beautiful white snake coiled inside. Himiko gasps in alarm, and the god-snake changes back to his human form. He is angry, tells her that she had been warned not to react, and that now he must leave her. Himiko, in her grief, stabs herself.</Text>

In popular representations in Japan, she is occasionally a seductress and occasionally a wise old queen, but she remains as popular as ever.</Text>

They delighted in combat and rejected husbands and sons, although they would visit the men of a neighboring tribe once a year. The Greeks placed them just beyond their eastern border, usually in Asia Minor on the edges of the Black Sea.

They pretended to be magicians who could bring back the dead and offered to show their trick to the dark lords by killing them, then bringing them back.

When his brothers refused to give him any fishing bait, he took a magical jawbone and baited it with his own blood to catch the mighty fish that became New Zealand’s North Island. While he was gone to find a priest (a tohunga) to perform the necessary rituals, his brothers came and began carving up the fish, which is why Aotearoa has mountains and valleys, and not a smooth plain, like a fish’s flank.

			<Text>Oya is the sister-wife to Shango, the god of thunder, and was the only one of his wives to stick with the loud-mouthed god. When they set off to war, they do so together, with Oya bringing the wind first, and Shango following afterwards with lightning.</Text>

			<Text>The two fight each other at times, too. Once, Oya had two buffalo horns on her head, and in the middle of a fight, she charged at Shango with them, meaning to gore him. Shango didn’t fight back; instead, he presented her favorite food: akara (bean cakes). Oya was so delighted that she surrendered her horns to him. Now, if Shango finds himself in trouble, all he has to do to summon Oya is to clack the horns together, and she comes with all the fury of the wind.</Text>

			<Text>Oya is still actively worshipped in Africa and the Caribbean. When a follower enters a trance and becomes possessed, she is notoriously loud and foul-mouthed, but, like the wind, promises to shake up whatever seems firmly rooted.</Text>

		<Replace Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_HERO_SINBAD_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The story of Sinbad the sailor comes from recent versions of the Thousand and One Nights and is set during the golden age of Arabia, during the reign of Haroun Al-Rashid. Sinbad’s tale is one where his bravery, intelligence and charm allow him to survive a series of increasingly perilous voyages. The structure of Sinbad’s tales is simple: he sails off, encounters and overcomes (or outwits) a series of fantastical and dangerous beasts or other enemies, and returns with riches. It is a formula that works well.</Text>

			<Text>In one voyage, Sinbad finds himself castaway on an island that was really a whale, and then being carried off by a giant roc, an eagle that lives in a diamond-studded valley and which hunted giant serpents for its dinner. On other voyages, Sinbad must charm kings, face down one-eyed giants, and keep sane on an island where the villagers are all addicted to a narcotic plant.</Text>

			<Text>If some of these stories sound a little familiar, you’re not wrong. Some of Sinbad’s tales are taken from the voyages of Odysseus, such as the cyclops and the lotus-eaters. While Western Europe was caught in the chaos of the Dark Ages, the Middle East was the repository for all of the wisdom and learning from Greece and Rome and linked to the glories of the Silk Road. This latter, too, was a source of stories: the legends of the roc and serpents is very similar to the Indian tales of the monstrous garuda bird and its serpentine naga prey. Sinbad’s voyages, then, reflect the wealth and imagination of an empire at the very heart of the world.</Text>

			<Text>One of the best-known and best-loved characters from Chinese legend, Sun Wukong – the Monkey King, has a tremendous quantity of stories surrounding him. His inspiration comes from a wide variety of sources. When China imported Buddhism from India during the Han Dynasty in around 150 AD, a number of Indian legends came along, including the Ramayana whose best supporting star was Hanuman, the lord of the monkeys and faithful sidekick to the hero Rama. As monkeys had already been seen as auspicious animals in previous Chinese dynasties, the notion of a magical monkey king was immensely popular and acquired a life of its own.</Text>

			<Text>Sun Wukong is not the noblest of heroes. He is at times selfish, at times unpredictable, and at all times mischievous. But unlike more devilish trickster deities like Loki, Sun Wukong ultimately is a force for good… once he can be controlled.</Text>

			<Text>Sun is stronger than all the armies of Heaven. He wields weapons that he stole from the dragon-king of the sea, including a golden staff so heavy that no other being can wield it, but capable of shrinking down so small that the Monkey King can store it in his ear; flying boots; and magical armor. When he is sentenced to death for these thefts, he simply steals the Book of Life and Death and erases his name from it (as well as the names of all the monkeys that he knows). Thus, when all the gods and all the armies of Heaven cannot stop him, the gods appeal to the Buddha, whose power is the greatest of all, and who imprisons the monkey in his palm.</Text>

			<Text>This is not it for Sun Wukong’s story, however. Centuries later, the goddess Guan Yin recruits the hero to protect the monk Tang Sanzang, who travels to India to receive the sacred Buddhist sutras. To control him, Guan Yin tricks him into wearing a magical circlet that tightens painfully when she recites the Tightening Sutra – sometimes, even the Goddess of Mercy needs to be harsh. The travelers face monsters and fantastical terrain as they travel to India, where the living Buddha hands the sacred texts to the monk.</Text>

		<!--Questing Knight-->
		<Replace Language="en_US" Tag="LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_QUESTING_KNIGHT_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>The Knights of the Round Table were, according to French and English legend of the 12th century and beyond, a group of warriors assembled by King Arthur. These stories – classics of both medieval chivalric romances and modern-day fairy tales – focused on the deeds of these knights. In the classic stories, their quests revolved around the defense of honor or Christian piety. In Gawain’s tale, for instance, the knight is challenged by a strange “Green Knight,” who mocks the honor of the Round Table. The Green Knight challenges Gawain to cut off his head, so long as Gawain agrees to let the Green Knight do the same to him. Gawain, a rough knight from the outer isles of Orkney, obliges, but to his surprise the Green Knight simply puts his severed head upon his shoulders and announces that he will receive Gawain the next year. This is a test of honor, of course – would Gawain show up to what is likely to be his death, or would he, as the non-canonical Sir Robin might put it, “gallantly chicken out?” Gawain remains true, of course, and the Table’s honor is kept.</Text>
