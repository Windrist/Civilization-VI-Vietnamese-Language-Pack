      <Text>With Dramatic Ages enabled, the stakes of each Age are much higher! Aside from the initial Age, each Age will be either Golden or Dark, depending on your civilization’s Era Score. You gain Era Score by completing Techs and Civics from the present Era or later. If you earn a Golden Age, any excess Era Score will turn into extra Loyalty pressure, which can be a significant factor if your neighbor has fallen into a Dark Age. In addition, you will have access to powerful Policy cards that you can use in the Wildcard slot of your government but watch out – entering a Dark Age means that some of your cities will rebel!</Text>
