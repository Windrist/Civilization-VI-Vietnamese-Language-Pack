		<Replace Language='en_US' Tag="LOC_FEATURE_FLOODPLAINS_GRASSLAND_DESCRIPTION">

			<Text>This mountain tile, probably located near a boundary between two continents, starts the game as an inactive volcanic site but may become active as the game progresses. Once active, beware -- an eruption could occur at any time. Volcanic eruptions damage features and structures in adjacent tiles but may also leave behind volcanic soil that boosts the yields from that location.</Text>

			<Text>The ground in this area, probably located near a boundary between two continents, has been ruptured by subterranean geothermal activity.

			<Text>This land adjacent to a volcano has suffered from a previous eruption. Although people and structures may have been damaged, the rich deposits of minerals the volcano has brought forth have probably enhanced the yields here. Rebuilding in this area may therefore be worthwhile, especially if the volcano goes dormant.</Text>
