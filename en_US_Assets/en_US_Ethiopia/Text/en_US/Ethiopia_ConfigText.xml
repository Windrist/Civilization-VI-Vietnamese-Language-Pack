		<Replace Language='en_US' Tag="LOC_GAMEMODE_SECRETSOCIETIES_DESCRIPTION">
			<Text>This game mode adds up to four powerful, mysterious, and often nefarious Secret Societies to the world, each based upon fictional or mythical organizations from the past. Their traces can be found in Barbarian Camps, Tribal Villages, or by sending Envoys to City-States and finding Natural Wonders. Alternatively, if other leaders have discovered a Society, you can learn about them by increasing your diplomatic visibility levels with them.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Discovering a Society does not mean joining it automatically, but it unlocks a new Governor that does not need to be assigned to a city. Spending a Governor Title on this governor means joining the society, giving you powerful bonuses. But choose wisely - once you appoint that Governor, you commit to membership for the rest of the game, and other leaders will react to your decision. Spend additional Governor Titles to prove your commitment to the Society and unlock its deeper mysteries.</Text>
