Between the dry desert and the flood-prone Tigris and Euphrates, the Babylonians had to learn how to control their rivers. And control them they did, even channeling the flow through palgum – small-scale canals – to feed elaborate gardens. While the Hanging Gardens of Babylon have not been as well documented as historians may have hoped, at Nineveh, the Assyrian king Sennacherib built a luxurious garden fed by aqueducts and elaborate canals – often the same waterway at different points, cutting through mountains and rising over canyons - that allowed for exotic trees such as ebony and rosewood to grow within the palace. These canals were reinforced by great limestone blocks and controlled by specialized sluice gates. The King was proud of these – he inscribed, “over deep-cut ravines, I spanned a bridge of white stone blocks. Those waters I caused to pass over upon it.” The Yazidi ethnic group in Iraq kept up this tradition of building elaborate aqueducts and canals well into the 20th century.</Text>

In the Chao Phraya valley, in modern-day Thailand, a series of Theravada Buddhist city-states called “mueang,” populated by Thai-speaking and Lao-speaking peoples, began to split off from the Khmer, asserting their own linguistic and cultural independence while retaining the religion, royal traditions, and many other cultural and legal features of the Khmer. Mueang were “mandala states,” kingdoms without defined borders but centered on a city that stressed beauty, artistic achievements, and cosmopolitan outlook – think of countries in that time not as the bounded puzzle pieces we see on a map today (or the bordered civilizations in your current game), but as magnets, drawing in people and power from the landscape. Power and profits came via royal monopolies on certain goods – especially porcelain or incense (the name of Vientiane, a Lao “mueang” from the same time, means “city of sandalwood”).</Text>

And, through the course of the 14th and 15th centuries, one became dominant. Ayutthaya, named after the city in the Hindu epic Ramayana [Ramakien, in Thai], became first the center of the Chao Phraya river plain, and, later, a significant power in mainland Southeast Asia, one that European travelers compared with India and China. In the course of its rise, Ayutthaya struggled diplomatically and militarily with its neighbors, especially the Burmese, who conquered Ayutthaya in the 1500s, but were rebuffed by the ambitious warrior-king Naresuan. Ayutthaya could also be the aggressor: at its height, Cambodia, parts of Malaysia, and Laos were controlled by the kings of Ayutthaya.</Text>

The kings of Ayutthaya were curious about the world and open to it, and employed Japanese, Arab, and European councilors to help them navigate the tricky realm of international diplomacy. The city itself, situated on an island in the middle of the Chao Phraya river, was large for the time, with about a quarter million residents, and had a cosmopolitan, polyglot nature – communities of Japanese, Chinese, and Europeans were established in the city and mingled with the locals. Gender roles, too, were relatively progressive in comparison with East Asia, South Asia, or Europe. One Chinese traveler remarked that “it is [Siamese] custom that all affairs are managed by their wives,” and Alexander Hamilton noted that the “Women in Siam are the only Merchants in buying Goods.”</Text>

In 1767, the Burmese sacked Ayutthaya and destroyed it, carrying off the gold of its temples, many of its skilled artisans, and putting most of the city to the torch. Siam reformed some years later further south, in a city called (in part) Krung Thep, a city known to foreigners as Bangkok. Today, Siam – Thailand - remains the only country in the region not to be formally colonized by a European power.</Text>

And when pilgrims returned, they brought back wonders. Chinguetti was a repository for learning during the height of the Almoravid empire in the 11th and 12th centuries with a significance that lasted well into the 16th. Relatedly, and like its larger relative, Timbuktu, Chinguetti was home to a number of famous libraries, places where pilgrims could share all that they had found on their travels. This went well beyond religion to include mathematics, science, astronomy, and especially Islamic law. These centers of scholarship – ksour – were bastions of Islamic life and commerce and would have been oases of learning in the desert.</Text>

These tensions erupted in the Soweto uprising in 1976, when black students marched against apartheid. The police, in response, shot them. As a result, Soweto, and the African National Congress gained a leading role in the resistance to apartheid, and the ANC came to power – and marked the end of apartheid – in 1994.</Text>

Scholars came from all around India, as well as China and Tibet, to learn from Buddhist scholars such as Nagarjuna, Dignaga, and Santaraksita. Buddhism today is broadly split into three main schools of thought: one common in Nepal and Tibet (Vajrayana), one common in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia (Theravada), and another spread across East Asia (Mahayana). In Nalanda, scholars debated all of these schools of thought, and Buddhist schools named for the great city now exist in places as far-flung as Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia.</Text>

Alexander the Great, approaching the kingdom, reportedly saw the walls and decided that he’d had enough movement eastward, and turned away. Nearly a thousand years later, in 629 AD, the Chinese monk Xuanzang visited Nalanda and brought Buddhist knowledge back to China. His travels were given a fanciful gloss in the famous Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” one of the most beloved Chinese epics. Xuanzang described Nalanda thusly: "an azure pool winds around the monasteries, adorned with the full-blown cups of the blue lotus; the dazzling red flowers of the lovely kanaka hang here and there, and outside groves of mango trees offer the inhabitants their dense and protective shade.”</Text>

In war, he led campaigns against the Turkic raider Timur (Tamerlane), and played a role in the machinations between Christian Castile, Tunisia, Egypt, and the Berber tribes of the Maghreb (North Africa).</Text>

His Muqaddimah is a provocative work that introduces several concepts that would only much later make their way into European thought. For instance, Ibn Khaldun introduces a cyclical notion of history. Whereas previous thinkers saw a gradual rise towards sedentary, agricultural life, Ibn Khaldun noted how periods of nomadic (Berber) rule came on the heels of settled life, and presented the tension between two ways of living – settled societies eventually decay, and more dynamic, adaptable nomads conquer them, only to find themselves growing accustomed to the comfort of their former foes. Such an idea was not to enter European thought until the work of Karl Marx, who also presented a notion of a productive clash between different economic modes as the driver of history.</Text>

The building attributed to Imhotep, the Pyramid of Djoser, is the earliest large-scale stone building in Egypt and the first pyramid to be used as a tomb. Whereas earlier pharaohs were interred in a rectangular mastaba, a rectangular tomb made of mud-brick, Imhotep’s pyramid was stone and on a colossal scale. The materials used were not simply piled atop each other, rather, the different qualities of building materials caused the four sides to lean into each other, further supporting the structure. Of course, pyramids were not only tombs – they contained within them shrines to the fallen pharaoh, including various parts of his divided soul, so in addition to the structure itself, there existed a whole complex both around and underneath the pyramid.</Text>

Modernism, especially in the imagination of architects like the Swiss Le Corbusier, promised to re-focus buildings away from tradition and towards a functionality that would also, owing to its very aesthetic and form, create new kinds of citizens. Le Corbusier’s buildings were often criticized, though, for their numbing quality and inorganic lines. Kenzo Tange, a student of Le Corbusier, sought to change this. Combining Le Corbusier’s sweeping concrete vision, Tange’s “metabolism” combined modern forms with organic ones and became influential in 1960s-era Japan and beyond. Rather than the modernist notion that modern architecture would make modern subjects, Tange envisioned a mutual becoming, one that also fused elements from Japanese traditional architecture, the natural world, and the imaginary of modernism.</Text>

In response, she said, “a healed femur.” By this, Mead was indicating the urge to help defenseless or weakened others in our society, and civilization as the system through which we bind ourselves together in mutual support. Mead’s anthropology involved in-depth ethnography, meaning a method of gathering data gained by living with people from very different backgrounds and seeking to understand them through shared personal experience. For anthropologists, seeing through very different eyes allows us to question what we might take for granted in our own society. Mead’s study of adolescence and sexuality in Samoa challenged conservative American cultural norms and became pivotal to the sexual revolution in the 1960s. Instead of a period where sexuality was held back from adolescents, and a natural conflict between parents and children, Mead found a more open acceptance of sexuality, and a lack of conflict. This, and Mead’s more interpretive approach (i.e. seeing anthropology as something more akin to history or literature than a “hard” science) led to a backlash from some circles, one that had more to do with present-day American politics than the quality of her work.</Text>

Combining Western piano music, especially marches, with African melodies, ragtime was characterized by the presence of a syncopated melody between the meter, giving the piece a “ragged” flavor or, to use Joplin’s word, a “swing.” Ragtime was popular in the 1890s – 1910s, before recorded music was widely available, and as such, it spread via sheet music or simply learned in performance. Ragtime, a largely African American musical style, broke the color barrier in music, a feat that was to be repeated with blues, jazz, rock, hip-hop, and other African American styles that defined larger American culture. Even overseas, European composers saw in ragtime their own growing interest in folk music reflected back with a distinctively American feel, and Dvorak, Stravinsky, and Debussy each were inspired to compose their own rags.</Text>

He was a rishi, a sacred hermit (a role that still exists across India and Southeast Asia), someone who lives a life of rural poverty in order to contemplate nature and religion. Valmiki is often referred to as the inventor of the shloka, a Sanskrit poetic form. Valmiki’s most famous work, composed some time around 500 BC, is the Ramayana.</Text>

Vishnu incarnates as a human, Rama, whose wife, Sita, Ravanna conspires to steal. When Ravanna whisks Sita off to Lanka (often situated in present-day Sri Lanka), Rama and his allies, including the monkey god Hanuman, undertake an epic journey to bring her back. The story has intriguing similarities with Homer’s work – a hero gathers a group of friends to fight another man who has sailed off with his wife.</Text>

      <Text>[COLOR_RED]TRANSLATION MISSING[ENDCOLOR][LOC_PEDIA_GREATPEOPLE_PAGE_GREAT_PERSON_INDIVIDUAL_WASSILY_KANDINSKY_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1]One of the pioneers of modern art, Wassily Kandinsky fused painting with philosophy, reflecting a world profoundly changed over the course of World War I, the Russian Revolution and World War II, at each point when the world seemed to be breaking down and rebuilding itself from the basic elements up. Modernism as a movement is a reaction to this reshaping of the world – "modernism" here does not mean up-to-date, rather, it is an attention to and rearrangement of the basic elements that make up a work. Modern art tries to play with these basic elements, giving up trying to represent objects and instead asking what effect a certain color or angle or arrangement would have upon the viewer, without the mess of asking, "what is this a painting of?". In other words, two lines in opposition might create a sense of drama; one soaring line might evoke lyricism. Circles are peaceful; colors have inherent resonances with particular sounds. This is not symbolism – it is not that Kandinsky's canvases are mysteries to be decoded; rather, the elements themselves share a fundamental link in Kandinsky's theory. Kandinsky's theoretical work became influential to the larger modernist and abstract movement and remains so today.</Text>

Returning to Germany, Kandinsky worked with the modernist Bauhaus movement until the Nazi period, during which time he fled to France, where he lived for the rest of his life.

Buddhist monks in a vihara are not the stereotype of silent worshippers simply seeking enlightenment via meditation. Rather, many monasteries are places of active learning – devotees are exposed to a wide variety of knowledge and encouraged to debate religious and scientific truths. The mahavihara of Nalanda was a massive complex that brought visitors from all across Asia precisely for this discussion and exchange. It contained within it a library that contained knowledge both of Buddhism as well as  literature and science, including several famous texts: Nagarjuna’s Madhyamaka, or the doctrine of emptiness; as well as the Four Vedas – Sanskrit texts that are vital to both Buddhism and Hinduism.
